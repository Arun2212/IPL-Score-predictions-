**IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning**

Data from 2008 to 2017 is used for this prediction. The dataset has features like venue, date, batting and bowling team, names of batsman and bowler, etc. 
The Dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qlm4OnaAM3bdgti9xyUqK3eSFokjYdA-/view)

After executing preprocessing steps such as Dropping unnecessary columns, Encoding, Feature Scaling, the data is then trained using Deep Learning Regression Model. The score prediction is shown below
